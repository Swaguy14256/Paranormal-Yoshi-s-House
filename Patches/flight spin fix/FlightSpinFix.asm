;;; Capespin-in-Flight fix
;;;   by Beta Logic
;;;
;;
;;  This patch guarantees that you will flip directions if you capespin mid-flight.
;;    It requires freespace and 1 RAM address to function properly.

!addr = $0000
!sa1 = 0
if read1($00FFD5) == $23

    !dp = $3000
    !addr = $6000
    !sa1 = 1

;; RAM address, for ease of understanding

  !MarioDir   = $76
  !hasFlight  = $1407|!addr
  !capeSpin   = $14A6|!addr
; This is the (normally) unused RAM address used for this patch
; Be sure that this is an unused address for your ROM!!

; Message Box choice selection patch by JackTheSpades (credit would be nice)
; http://www.smwcentral.net/?p=profile&id=7869
;
; This patch allows you to have cursor in the message box to select between multiple options.
; The message box opens and closes like usual and can be edited in Lunar Magic.
; Note: The selection only stores a value to a RAM address, if you actually want the selection
;       to do something, you'll have to code that yourself (meaning, ASM knowledge is required)
; The part where you want to edit the code is a bit below, shouldn't be hard to find.
; For further information, see the readme.

;All messages have to be inbetween the label and the .end

;format/how to use
;%messages(table, level, messagebox, ram, leftrigh, routine)
;table				-	the label to the positions table above
;level				-	the Lunar Magic level number you enter on the OW (not $13BF format)
;messagebox			-	which message box to use ($1 or $2)
;ram				-   where to store the cursor position (some empty RAM would be best)
;						has to be a long address (eg. $7E0079 instead of just $79)
;leftright			-	how much the cursor should jump if left/right is pressed
;routine			-	a routine to call when the message box has fully closed,
;						put ReturnLong there if you don't want it to do anything.
;						the routine has to end with RTL
MessageBoxData:
	;example: use sometablename defined above, for level 105, message box 1
	;store result to $79 (+SA1), don't use left/right buttons and don't do anything
	;when message box closes.
	;Also, take note that if you want to access I-RAM area, make sure to use
	;!BaseLong1 or if you want to access BW-RAM, use !BaseLong2
	;If ROM isn't SA-1, then it will default to the WRAM area ($7E-7F)
	;Just remember to ADD the RAM value, eg. !BaseLong2+$0660
	;$40:0660 or $6660. Bear that in mind!

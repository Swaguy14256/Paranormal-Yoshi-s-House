; Slope Pass Glitch Fix 2.1 by lolcats439 (SA-1/SuperFX hybrid by LDA)
; This patch fixes the glitch that lets Mario pass through slopes by flying/jumping/swimming through them at a shallow angle.

; The actual fix is a single hex edit, but there's a side effect, it then doesn't let you jump up
; through a slope normally, it will stick you to it and zero your y speed, which is annoying and
; probably the reason Nintendo made the code only run if moving up in the first place.
; This patch works around that by not running the slope assist code when Mario is moving at a
; shallower angle than the slope itself, so you can jump up through it but not glitch under it.

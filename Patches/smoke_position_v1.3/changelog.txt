v1.3
-----
Fixed a bug with tide l3 interaction not spawning splash + not pushing / stopping the player.

v1.2
-----
Fixed a bug with fastrom that caused the torpedo ted's smoke to be placed wrong.

v1.1
-----
SA-1 compatible. Read the header comment in the patch, however for 'specifics'.
New High byte sets for: end level smoke, reznor bridge / summo bro, morton/roy/ludwig death animation
Fixed a bug with motors in general that would displace the smoke for 00F2, instead of FFF2.
Added some minor comments at least for each hijack.

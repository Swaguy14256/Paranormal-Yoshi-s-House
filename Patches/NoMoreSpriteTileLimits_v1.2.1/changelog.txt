v1.2.1
-----
Now the patch can search 2 additional slots ($34,$30). The Lakitu Cloud reserved slots have been moved to $28,$2C to accomodate this.

v1.2
-----
Added a compatibility flag that moves the sprite header back to 10.
Added a compatibility flag so that you can disable this patch from working in all sprite headers. Instead it will only be enabled for the configured sprite header.

v1.1
-----
Ported sa-1 code to fastROM.
Now enabled in all sprite headers.
Changed sprite header 08 to have the same amount of slots as sprite header 10 (or 00), to match sa-1's new max slot header. Sprite header 08 is unused.
